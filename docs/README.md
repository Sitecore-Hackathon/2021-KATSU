# SXA Site Marketplace



SXA provides Authors and developers with an Array of tools and components that speeds up the site development, but sometimes you need the site even faster; this is where our module comes in, it provides users a marketplace with already built sites along with the theme,

due to the limited time frame we are working on we provided a POC with only one Site, our vision is to create a full site that developers can submit their sites to it which creates new opportunities for developers to contribute to the community, and the module would read directly from this site 
for the sake of keeping within the timeline the sites now includes the Tenant which ideally shouldn't
